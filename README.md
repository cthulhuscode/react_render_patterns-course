# React Render Patterns Course

This course allowed me to learn about:

1. Component composition.
2. Render props and Render functions.
3. Higher Order Components (HOCs).
4. Compare the use of Render props vs HOCs vs Hooks.

The project made was a [To-Dos App](https://cthulhuscode.github.io/react_render_patterns-course/)
