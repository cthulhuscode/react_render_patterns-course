# Component composition

Component composition in React is a technique of building complex user interfaces by combining smaller and simpler components together to form a more significant and robust structure. In other words, it is a way of creating a hierarchy of components where each component is responsible for a specific feature or functionality of the user interface.

The concept of component composition is based on the idea of modularity, where a large system is divided into smaller, manageable and reusable parts. This approach helps in creating more flexible and maintainable code, as each component can be tested and modified independently without affecting other parts of the application.

In React, component composition is achieved by nesting components inside one another to create a tree-like structure of components. This tree structure allows developers to break down the UI into small, reusable pieces, which can be easily combined and reassembled to create more complex UI elements.

For example, a simple component, such as a button, can be composed with other components, such as text fields, icons, and labels, to create a more complex component, such as a form. This process of composing smaller components into larger ones allows developers to create highly customizable, scalable and reusable UI elements.
